                        <p>Firebase, initially called Envolve, was first started as a chat API for websites. Over time, the developers realized that their API was commonly used to pass app data (i.e. game states) across their users. This lead them to separate the chat system from the data link service that powered it. Thus Firebase was born - an API that synchronizes data across iOS, Android, and Web devices. The Firebase development suite offers a variety of services in four major categories: Analytics, Development, Stability, and Grow, including Google Analytics (Google acquired Firebase in 2017), cloud functions, machine learning, app stability, and messaging.<p/>

                        <p>When Realm was launched in 2014, its goal was to help mobile developers build better apps faster by giving them a powerful alternative to SQLite and Core Data. Realm's two major components, the Realm Database and the Realm Object Server use socket connections to automatically synchronize data and minimize the complexity of database management. The Realm Mobile Platform also boasts an open source embedded database library, which allows the use of offline functionalities - a feature that sets them apart from other providers. Interestingly, Realm uses a data container model, in which nearly all data objects are stored in Realm as objects. Even the service iteself is an instance of a Realm Mobile Database container.<p/>

They support many different programming languages and tools, including many software and systems not developed by Microsoft. Like most MBaaS providers, Azure supports the major mobile OS's: iOS and Android, and their own mobile OS, Windows. When it comes to security, it may be one of the providers higher up on the list. According to their website, "Microsoft invests more than USD 1 billion annually on cybersecurity research and development, employ more than 3,500 security experts completely dedicated to your data security and privacy, and has more compliance certifications than any other cloud provider."
